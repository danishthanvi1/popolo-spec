In some cases, it is relevant to represent the organizational structure independently of the people within that structure; for example, it is relevant to represent the position of the Member of Parliament for Avalon even when no one holds that position. A *post* is such a position that exists independently of the person holding it.

A post should not be confused with a *role*, which describes a function that a person can fulfill. For example, many people fulfill the *role* of “CEO” in different organizations, but only one person holds the *post* of “CEO at Apple Inc.” Indeed, the post of the MP for Avalon could be described as having the role of MP.

According to this data specification, a [person](/specs/person.html) holds a post in an [organization](/specs/organization.html) through their [membership](/specs/membership.html) in that organization, as illustrated by the class diagram below.

<h1 id="use-cases-and-requirements">1. Use cases &amp; requirements</h1>

The Post class should have properties for:

1. label

    >Member of Parliament for Avalon

1. alternate labels

    >"CEO" is an abbreviation of "Chief Executive Officer".

1. the function that the holder of the post fulfills

    >Member of Parliament

1. the [organization](/specs/organization.html) in which the post is held

    >House of Commons

1. the [geographic area](/specs/area.html) to which the post is related

    >Avalon

1. date of creation

    >The Canadian federal electoral district of Westmount—Ville Marie was established in 1996, thereby creating the post of Member of Parliament for Westmount—Ville Marie.

1. date of elimination

    >The Canadian federal electoral district of Annapolis was abolished in 1914, thereby eliminating the post of Member of Parliament for Annapolis.

1. the means of contacting the holder of the post

    >1 Main Street  
    Anytown, USA  
    555-555-0100  
    treasurer@example.com

1. external links

<h1 id="standard-reuse">2. Standard reuse</h1>

Briefly, the [survey of existing specifications](/appendices/survey.html) concludes that:

* Only the [Organization ontology](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/) offers a sufficiently rich model for describing organizational structure.
* `schema:validFrom`, `schema:validUntil` and [`dct:valid`](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-valid) are the only properties for creation dates and elimination dates.

## 2.1. Changes to data model

The [Organization ontology](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/)'s data model is unsuitable for representing:

* a previously held post

    >Michael Ignatieff was Member of Parliament for Etobicoke—Lakeshore until 2011.

* the date on which the person currently holding a post started holding it

    >Barack Obama assumed office January 20, 2009.

Within the Organization ontology, there is also significant overlap in responsibility between the Membership and Post classes, leading to confusion as to when one, the other, or both is required or recommended for a particular use case.

According to the Organization ontology, people hold posts directly; in order to resolve the above issues, in this data specification, people hold posts indirectly through memberships. Therefore, the properties `org:heldBy` and `org:holds` <em class="rfc2119">should not</em> be used.

## 2.2. Range restrictions

According to the Organization ontology, either a person or an organization can hold a post in an organization; in this data specification, only a person can hold a post in an organization.

<p class="note" id="note1">1. The <code>role</code> property appears on both the Post and Membership classes, as there are uses cases where you will have no posts (e.g. describing club membership) and others where you will have no memberships (e.g. describing organizational structure).</p>
<p class="note" id="note2">2. The Organization ontology defines the inverse property <code>org:hasPost</code>.</p>

<h1 id="serialization">4. Serialization</h1>

A post cannot exist outside an organization. All posts <em class="rfc2119">must</em> assign a value to either `organization_id` or `organization`.

**JSON differences from other RDF serializations:**

* The term `label` is used instead of `prefLabel`, to be consistent with the [ContactDetail](/specs/contact-detail.html) class.
* The term `other_label` is used instead of `altLabel` to be consistent with other classes using `other_names`.
* The value of the `role` property is a string, instead of an `org:Role`.
* The term `organization` is used instead of `postIn` to be consistent with the [Membership](/specs/membership.html) class.
* The terms `start_date` and `end_date` are used instead of `validFrom` and `validUntil`, to be consistent with the [Membership](/specs/membership.html) class.
* The term `links` is used instead of `seeAlso` and is serialized as an array of [link objects](/specs/#link).
